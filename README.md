# Simple_Bit_Encryptor_C
A very simple code to manipulate or switch the bits in C.
This simple bit encryptor is created to support code exploitation and reverse engineering challenge creators.

## The simple_bit_encryptor.c
A bit encrypting source code. The process produces a text saving the encrypted message.

## The encryptor.out
A executable program to encrypt a message by manipulating the message's bits.

## The simple_bit_decryptor.c
A bit decrypting source code. The code requires a cipher text, the path and the cipher's name can be changed in the code.

## The decryptor.out
A executable program to decrypt the encrypted message by manipulating the cipher's bits.
